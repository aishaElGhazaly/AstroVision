# AstroVision

  

AstroVision is a PyQt5-based desktop application for astronomical data exploration and visualization, powered by SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) data. It provides a modular, tabbed interface for searching, retrieving, visualizing, and processing astronomical images and spectra.

  

## Features

  

-  **Search**: Query SDSS data using various filters and conditions, view results in a table, and export results.

-  **Quick Look**: Fetch and display SDSS images by coordinates, with metadata and overlay options.

-  **FITS Retrieval**: Download or inspect FITS files by RA/DEC, Run-Camcol-Field, or from a local directory. View metadata and inspect files.

-  **Composite Creation**: Create RGB composite images from FITS files, with preprocessing, alignment, and export to image or FITS.

-  **Spectrogram Inspector**: Retrieve and visualize spectra by RA/DEC or Plate-MJD-FiberID, with interactive plots and metadata.

-  **Image Enhancement**: (Coming soon) Placeholder for future image processing tools.

  

## Installation

  

1.  **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

```

python -m venv AV-env

```

3.  **Activate the environment**:

- Windows: `AV-env\Scripts\activate`

4.  **Install dependencies**:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

  

## Usage

  

Run the main application:

```

python AV.py

```

The main window will open with navigation cards for each module.

  

## Requirements

  

- Python 3.11+ (recommended)

- See `requirements.txt` for all dependencies (notable: PyQt5, astropy, numpy, matplotlib, reproject, pyqtgraph, pillow).

  

## Modules Overview

  

-  **AV.py**: Main application entry point and window/tab management.

-  **search.py**: SDSS data search with advanced filtering and result export.

-  **quick_look.py**: Quick image fetch and display with metadata and overlays.

-  **fits_retrieval.py**: Download, inspect, and view FITS files and their metadata.

-  **composite_creation.py**: Build and export RGB composites from FITS images.

-  **spectrogram_inspector.py**: Fetch, plot, and export astronomical spectra.

-  **image_enhancement.py**: Placeholder for future enhancements.

-  **utilities.py**: Helper functions for data fetching, validation, and processing.

  

## Notes

  

- The application uses a dark theme and custom-styled widgets for a modern look.

- The "Image Enhancement" module is currently a placeholder.

- The app icon is `icon.png`.

  
#### I believe AstroVision can grow into an open-source community-driven tool for astronomical exploration.
