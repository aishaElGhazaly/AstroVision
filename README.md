AstroVision is a PyQt5-based desktop application for astronomical data exploration and visualization, powered by SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) data. It provides a modular, tabbed interface for searching, retrieving, visualizing, and processing astronomical images and spectra.

## Features

- **Search**: Query SDSS data using various filters and conditions, view results in a table, and export results.
- **Quick Look**: Fetch and display SDSS images by coordinates, with metadata and overlay options.
- **FITS Retrieval**: Download or inspect FITS files by RA/DEC, Run-Camcol-Field, or from a local directory. View metadata and inspect files.
- **Composite Creation**: Create RGB composite images from FITS files, with preprocessing, alignment, and export to image or FITS.
- **Spectrogram Inspector**: Retrieve and visualize spectra by RA/DEC or Plate-MJD-FiberID, with interactive plots and metadata.
- **Image Enhancement**: *(Coming soon)* Placeholder for future image processing tools.

## Modules Overview

- `AV.py`: Main application entry point and window/tab management
- `search.py`: SDSS data search with advanced filtering and result export
- `quick_look.py`: Quick image fetch and display with metadata and overlays
- `fits_retrieval.py`: Download, inspect, and view FITS files and their metadata
- `composite_creation.py`: Build and export RGB composites from FITS images
- `spectrogram_inspector.py`: Fetch, plot, and export astronomical spectra
- `image_enhancement.py`: Placeholder for future enhancements
- `utilities.py`: Helper functions for data fetching, validation, and processing

---

## Notes

- The application uses a dark theme and custom-styled widgets for a modern look.
- The "Image Enhancement" module is currently a placeholder.
- The app icon is `icon.png`.
